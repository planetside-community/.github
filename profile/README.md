We automate a **lot** of the PlanetSide 2 Community Discord. Here's where most of that automation lives! :)

Some services use our sister project [ps2.live](https://github.com/genudine), and data upstream from that.

## Automation

- **discord-messages** - Messages sent by "Papa Vanu" bot. Central repo for useful-guides, welcome-rules, and channel pins.

## Bots

- **discord-room-bot** - Provides the functionality behind "âž• Create a Room" voice channels
- **voice-channel-population-bot** - Provides the functionality behind the population & continents in channel names
- **game-updates-bot** - Provides the functionality behind "game-updates" forum channel
